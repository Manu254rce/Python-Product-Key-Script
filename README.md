# Python-Product-Key-Script
Can't recall your product key? A short script Python file that gets you the key from a command line code that scans through system registry. Feel free to add commits and modifications to the code as you wish.

The code includes the subprocess module in it, which enables workability of Python script as a cmd line string in the Windows terminal, then the pyperclip module will assign the output to the clipboard.
